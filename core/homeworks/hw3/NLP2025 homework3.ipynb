    "**Your answer**:  Sweet is closer to salty than to sweetened, and similarly as close to salty as to sugary. Our explanation would be that, in this case, sweet and salty occur more frequently in the same context in sentences together (we thought of recipes, food lists, reviews, in which such words could both occur). While sweetened is a synonym, we argue that sweetened is not that often used in the same context as sweet, while salty is. The fact that salty is an antonym is overridden by the fact that it appears more frequently in the sliding window around sweet. Sugary is an example of a synonym that is often used to describe food, and is obviously present more often in the context window around sweet; therefore, the distance between sweet and sugary matches the difference between sweet and salty.\n",
    "NOTE: sweet is also a polysemous word, but in this case we refer to the literate meaning of the sweet, characterizing taste of something.w1='equal'\n"

    "### Exercise 2.1.4 Polysemous Words (0.5 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some words are polysemous, i.e. they have multiple meanings. For example the word *bank* can be a financial institute or the rising ground bordering a lake or river. Find a polysemous word whose top most similar words contains related words from multiple meanings. You should use the the [`wv_google.most_similar()`](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html) function to compute the closet neighbours of the word. You may increase the number of neighbours in order to identify multiple groups of meanings. Submit the ranked word list and explained how the words are grouped into different meanings."

    "**YOUR ANSWER**: [1] suggest training a multiple embeddings for each of the words. Idea is to perform a forward pass through the model and extrapolate different embeddings from a singular vector representation, hypothesizing that that would lead to performance gain, since we are increasing expressivity, since each embedding that would represent a word could be used by the model (learned to do so) to properly represent the word. One vector could represent base meaning of the word, others could pick up other meaning and contexts in which the word appears. [2] proposes a two-stage method. First, learn global embeddings, then in the second stage adaptievely learn the local embeddings in the latent space to model polysemy. [3]  propose an LSTM with attentional multi-sense embeddings that assigns multiple sense vectors to each word.\n",

    "**YOUR ANSWER to Why this happens:** Word2Vec finds similar words based on the corpus at hand. Given that corpora differ significantly, variations are expected. It is clear that the word human will not be used in the same context across domains; therefore, it makes sense that similar words to the target word differ across domains, as the algorithms are highly dependent on the data. In case of astro dataset, we'd expect astronaut to be similar, and it was. In case of medline dataset, we expected  more medical terms, which were indeed returned (eg. extraembryonic)"

    "\n",
    "-Analogy-Optimized Model (300d CBOW, window=5): Achieves best performance on complex semantic reasoning tasks. The larger dimensionality and wider context window help capture more nuanced word relationships needed for analogical reasoning.\n",

Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.

A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as \"open and transparent,\" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. \"This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,\" Stone said. \"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces.\" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. \"There are no secrets that go on in detention,\" Stone said. \"Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.\" See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls » . By the time of their release, \"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

    "**ANSWER** :  decoder-only LLM model generates a long summary sequence, failing to actually summarize the text. It scores lowest at with ROUGE-1 of 11% and rougeL of 9.7%. Encoder-decoder LLM's (flan-t5-small and  bart-large-cnn) generate much more convincing, few-sentence summaries, which refllects in the higher ROUGE metrics. flan-t5-small sc ores 26% annd bart-large-cnn scores 43% ROUGE-1 with prompt \"Summarize this text\". bart-large-cnn generally scores better than  flan-t5-small, as flan-t5-small  sometimes outputs gibberish, while bart  is much more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also looked at the model card of bart-large-cnn, and used official transformers pipeline for summarization, where we scored the same as when we used originall prompt (42% vs 43% ROUGE-1). When we used prompt \"You are a helpful assistant. Summarize this text\", ROUGE-1 goes up to 47%.\n",

    "Therefore, final conclusion is that optimal model is bart-large-cnn, with encoder-decoder structure.\n",

    "And to answer one of the previous questions, when we didn't include \":\" in \"write a haiku\" task, decoder-only model generates text not as an answer to that task, but rather as a addition to the question being asked. Therefore \":\" is needed to generate the respsonse to t he askedd question, and not to complete  the question itself."

    "YOUR ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "Our commentary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our experiments applying prompt engineering on the museum label generation task, we noted differences in the quality of the text produced. Adopting the zero-shot technique resulted in outputs that were lifeless textbooks, boring and unengaging, especially for the adolescent demographic. On the other hand, the role + style prompting approach improved audience appropriateness considerably, and the model even tried informal language and some metaphorical language, even if most attempts failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain-of-thought model gave the most structured output, which was divided into sections on the artist's background, context, and significance. Still, it struggled with the imaginative elements and went on to exceed the word limit. The most consistent adherence to structure came with the few-shot learning approach, but this required careful example selection to prevent overfitting to certain patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the checklist conversion task, few-shot learning completed the task in a properly formatted style that matched the example, which suggests that for certain format tasks, providing examples is more effective than having extensive instructions."
